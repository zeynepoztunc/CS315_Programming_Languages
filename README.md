# CS315_Programming_Languages
This repository contains my homeworks for the Bilkent University CS15 Programming Languages course.
- `Homework 1` : Associative Arrays in Dart, Javascript, Lua, PHP, Python, Ruby, and Rust
   - `Description`:  In this homework assignment, we were asked to investigate the associative array data structures provided in seven different programming languages: Dart, Javascript, Lua, PHP, Python, Ruby and Rust. I invesitgated how to initialize get/add/modify/delete the elements of the associative array as well as searching for the existence of a key and of a value in the array and looping through the array.  
 - `Homework 2` : User-Located Loop Control Mechanisms in Dart, Javascript, Lua, PHP, Python, Ruby, and Rust
   - `Description`:  In this homework assignment, we were asked to investigate user-located loop control mechanisms such continue and break provided in seven different programming languages: Dart, Javascript, Lua, PHP, Python, Ruby and Rust. I invesitgated how to continue/break and similar statements are implemented in these languages and used loops to demonstrate the use of such mechanisms.
- `Homework 3` : Subprograms in Dart
   - `Description`:  In this homework assignment, we were asked to investigate suprograms in Dart. I especially, investigated nested subprogram definitions, scope of local variables, different parameter passing methods, keyword and default parameters and closures in Dart.
